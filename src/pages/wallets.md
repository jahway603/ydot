### YecWallet

YecWallet is a full node Ycash wallet. It includes ycashd, the node software that powers the Ycash network, and will take care of configuring ycashd for you!

Because it is a full node, YecWallet will download the entire Ycash blockchain via the Ycash peer-to-peer network. (Currently, the blockchain is around 21 GB.)
